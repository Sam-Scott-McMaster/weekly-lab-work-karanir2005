My Predection: 

A,B,C,D are variables
A=a
B=1
C="$A${B}C" = "a1C"
D=$B*10 = "1*10"

echo "$A $B $C $D"

Expected Output:  a 1 a1C 1*10

Actual Output: a 1 a1C 1*10

My prediction was right: The variable A stores string value a, B stored string 1, c stored A+B+"C", therefore a1C and d stores "1"+"*10" = "1*10" and the output is: A B C D  - all variables seperated by a space.
