In C, you can access elements in an array using either indices or pointers. When using pointers, you are directly accessing the memory where the array is stored, which can be more efficient. This is especially helpful when working with large arrays or when passing arrays to functions, because it saves memory by avoiding copying the whole array.
However, pointer arithmetic can be tricky for beginners. Itâ€™s easy to make mistakes, like going out of bounds, which can lead to errors that are hard to debug. Pointers also make the code less readable for someone who is new to programming.
