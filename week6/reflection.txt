The & operator in C allows functions to modify variables outside their scope by passing their addresses instead of value.
For instance, in the function "int digits(long n, int *max, int *min)" using & lets us update max and min directly, enhancing efficiency and allowing multiple outputs. We wouldn't have to return these values. we can "return"/change multiple values of different types. However, this practice can introduce risks like the variables not being usable in loops anymore (since their value changes) Using the pointer reduces code readability as well. Its a vital tool for C however comes with its risks.
